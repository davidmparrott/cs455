not copied correctly:
chmod 777 ftpclient_hw.py

description:
ftpclient_hw.py uses a brute force technique to attempt to access
an ftp server. The server name is specified in the header of the 
script and can be easil changed. All possible ports from 1 - 65535
are scanned looking for open ports. If the server is listening on
a given port then the script attempts to open a connection and 
retrieve a response. If that response contains the string "FTP"
it is assumed that this is an FTP server.

The username to attempt to use for server login is also specified
in the header; however, the potential passwords are read from a text
file and an attempt to login using each is made from the end of the
file working backwards towards the beginning.

After a connection is established and the script has logged in
a search is done for files containing the strings "cs455" and
"programming" which are then downloaded.

As soon as that is retreived the script closes and exits.
